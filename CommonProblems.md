## Common Problems

1. **My calendarView has one of the following problems**:
   * It is bouncing around in the view 
   * It has some white space at the top which pushes the view down

In [Apple Documentation](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/UIKit/Reference/UIViewController_Class/index.html#//apple_ref/occ/instp/UIViewController/automaticallyAdjustsScrollViewInsets) it states.

Therefore, is it possible for your app that you can deselect this option for the viewController?
