Hi, i'm Jay. A programmer with an interest in iOS programming.

### Inspiration behind this project


1. Apple has no calendar control.
2. Other calendar projects on Github try to cram every feature into their control, hoping it will meet the programmer's requirements.

This is an incorrect way to build controls. It leaves the developer with an extremely wide selection of (in many cases non-conventional) features that he has to sift through in order to configure the calendar. Also, no matter how wide the feature selection, the developer is always restricted to a predefined configuration-set shipped with the calendarControl. Do you see Apple building their UITableView by guessing what they think you want the UITableView to look like? No. So neither should we.
